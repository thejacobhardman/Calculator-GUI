# Calculator-GUI

This is a simple calculator program that contains some UI enhancements as well as some sound effects.

Make sure that the sound files are in the same folder as the 'Calculator.py' file or the program will not play sound correctly.

The program will display a warning message if the user attempts to calculate an impossible or incorrect statement.
